# Tax Agile - Developer Hub
The Tax Agile Developer Hub contains resources for developers integrating with Tax Agile via RESTful web services. 

It includes [API Swagger OAS3 docs](docs/swagger/index.html), [sample API requests](docs/postman.md) and documentation to [get started](docs/getting-started.md).

## Authentication

* API key authentication
  * Credential pair of API key and Account id are used to create a Bearer token
  * The token is valid for 24hrs and is used as the Authentication on subsequent requests

## Data manager

* Introduced in v1.3.0 of the API - data manager route handles uploads of data
  * Replaces the ```POST /v1/auditor/vat/audits``` resource as the way to send data to VAT Filer

## VAT Determination
* Send a transaction for VAT Determination
  * Receiving back context rich error messaging if your transaction is missing a field required for the determination to complete
  * Returns an analysis for the transaction
  * Allows for the transaction to be sent and not saved, or sent with a commit flag
  * Can use tax codes setup in the application to include an ERP tax code in the response, with the useTaxCodes flag
* Get a list of transactions saved
  * Paginated results
  * Filter parameters on entry date/time range, document number & VAT code
  * This can be used to collect data from Tax Agile and store in your data warehouse

## VAT Auditor
* Create an Audit 
  * Receive an operation id to poll for audit completion
* Get a list of audits on the system
* Fetch summary details of a specific audit by id
* Fetch audit results by id
* Delete an audit by id

## VAT Filer
* API for VAT Filer will be coming soon, but you can already send data to VAT Filer using the ``` POST /v1/datamanager/vat/uploads ``` resource.

### Getting Credentials
Get in touch via our website: [vatcalc.com/contact](https://www.vatcalc.com/contact/) to setup a demo and we can provide you with a trial!

### FAQ
* **Samples**: If you are having any trouble building a request from the Swagger documentation, first find the sample for that endpoint in the Postman collection as it contains working payloads, which might help you identify the issue. 
* **Boolean data type**: Provide a boolean `true` or `false`, not a string `"true"` or `"false"`
* **Numbers**: Financial values are represented in JSON as number types, for example `100.00` rather than `"100.00"`
